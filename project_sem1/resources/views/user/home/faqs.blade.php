            <p id="pbox3" style="display: none;">Nexus Aquarium has several sanitization and cleanliness procedures, many of which have been enhanced given the awareness of COVID-19. Our Environmental Operations team continually cleans and disinfects frequently touched places like handles, elevators, faucets, counters, and more. We have placed additional hand sanitizer units in gallery entrances and exits and additional signage in our restrooms indicating proper handwashing techniques. For staff, disinfectant wipes, hand sanitizer, and gloves are available for all employees and volunteers.</p>
